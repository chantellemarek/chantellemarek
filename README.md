### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Chantelle Marek!
I'm currently working as a Web Developer Intern. The company I intern with is trying to improve the gender pay gap. Not only that, but trying to empower women. My current career interest is trying to become a Web Developer. Due to that, I am learning more about CSS, HTML, JavaScript. While I have no experience with React, I am reading React Explained by Zac Gordon to learn the language.
