### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Chantelle Marek!
I am a young, female software developer that is highly motivated. May 2021, I graduated with an Associate's Degree in Software Developer. During my two years of schooling, I was on the President's List (often called the Dean's List) four consecutive semesters. Due to this excellent academic achievement, I graduated with honors.
